# What

A small (rough draft) CLI tool for extracting useful information from
a Toggl time tracking detailed view csv. Currently the only ability is
to do a two-level view of tasks rolled up under a project rollup.

# Why

Two reasons, really:

1. I wanted this view of the data and I couldn't figure out how to get
   the toggl reports interface to give it to me.
1. I wanted a chance to play around with Rust.

Missions accomplished.
